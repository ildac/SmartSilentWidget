SmartSilentWidget
=================

Simple widget, inspired by a [ptrprograms post](http://ptrprograms.blogspot.it/2014/11/building-widget-to-silence-phone.html)
i came across trough the [AndroidWeekly Newsletter](http://androidweekly.net/) (if you are not subscribed do it immediatly!)

The widget icon is made by [Designmodo](https://www.iconfinder.com/designmodo).

To suggest future idea, or to see what i've in mind check out the [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/5UzqvmbU/smartsilentwidget)
